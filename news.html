  Effective March 26, 2020, Western’s Amit Chakma Engineering Building (ACEB) officially received LEED Platinum certification, making it only the third academic building in Canada to achieve that level.

  The building brings to life a vision set by Andrew Hrymak, former Engineering Dean and now Provost and Vice-President Academic.

  “I am incredibly proud of this achievement and of all those involved in the process,” said Hrymak. “Attaining LEED Platinum status was an objective from the outset and encouraged by Advisory Council members, donors and the Faculty. It’s remarkable to see the years of work and collaboration within our community come to fruition.”

  Hrymak stressed the invaluable work done by Western Engineering staff, faculty and students at every stage of ACEB’s design. Special mentions were given to former Associate Dean, Undergraduate Studies and recently retired Civil Engineering professor Mike Bartlett and Director of Administration Christina Bobier, who helped Hrymak spearhead the project from start to finish; and to the Undergraduate Engineering Society, who were fundamental in gathering student feedback concerning the building’s functional design.

  Of the 2,600 LEED-certified buildings in Canada, less than 5% are recognized as LEED Platinum. The LEED Canada rating system takes several factors into consideration, including sustainable sites, water efficiency, energy and atmosphere, materials and resources, innovation in design, and indoor environmental quality.
